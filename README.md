# Predictive Network
This is a Recurrent Predictive Coding neural network with unified IO.

# Predictive Coding
Predictive Coding is a model of deep learning that more closely resembles the learning mechanisms of the brain than the popular back-propagation. Rather than pausing the state of the network and cascading the update through the network, each neuron and weight is updated independantly using only local information.

# Recurrent Unified IO
Rather than the network having layers, the network contains one big layer which is called the state which is topologically equivalent to the vertices of an arbitrary graph. The recurrance of the state allows information to propagate from any neuron to any other neuron. The topology of the weight connections is becomes emergent behavior.
